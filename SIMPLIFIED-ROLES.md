## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Level:**
```sql
-- Managers now have same RLS access as admins
CREATE POLICY "Admins and managers can update company" ON companies
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles p 
      WHERE p.id = auth.uid() 
        AND p.company_id = companies.id 
        AND p.role IN ('admin', 'manager')
    )
  );
```

### **Application Level:**
```javascript
// Single permission check covers both roles
const canManageCompany = isManager; // true for both admin and manager
const canCreateOrders = isManager;   // true for both admin and manager
const canInviteUsers = isManager;    // true for both admin and manager
```

---

## 🎭 **User Experience**

### **During Signup:**
- Users see clear role descriptions
- Manager and Admin both show "Full company access"
- Workers clearly understand their task-focused role

### **In Application:**
- All management features available to both Admin and Manager

## 🔮 **Future Differentiation (When Needed)**

When you want to separate Admin and Manager permissions later:

### **Easy Steps:**
1. **Update** `isManager` logic to exclude admins
2. **Create** `isAdminOrManager` helper for shared permissions
3. **Add** admin-specific features using `isAdmin` helper
4. **Update** UI to show role-specific features

### **Example Future Admin-Only Features:**
- Billing and subscription management
- Company deletion/transfer
- Advanced security settings
- User activity audit logs
- Data export and compliance
